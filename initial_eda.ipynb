      "Question: I planted my first tree (an eastern redbud) four days ago. I just learned that the tree is supposed to be dug three times the width of the container it came in. Before it really starts to grow, can I just simply aerate around it with a spading fork; or should I replant it to make sure the hole is wide enough?\n",

      "Answer: It depends a bit on the kind of soil you have.\n",
      "In a rather compact and dense environment, the wide hole is important because otherwise the tree can find itself sitting in what’s essentially a “pot” again and that can (and will, speaking from experience) stunt its growth. A wide hole gives the tree a good head start for root development and potentially breaking through the borders. So if you struggled to dig the original hole and really had to work through the ground, it’s probably a good idea to replant, but please be careful with the existing roots and take the tree out very carefully and gently, but do it as soon as possible. For these cases, it’s also best to not just refill the hole with the original soil, but to include some more structural organic material like compost or bagged planting soil.\n",
      "If however you are blessed with a more loose soil structure, that shouldn’t be an issue and I would rather leave the tree alone.\n",
      "Aerating the soil is not going to do much in the former scenario (because by the time the roots will extend out, the soil will likely have compacted again) and not necessary in the latter.\n",

      "Generally you want to reduce the cutting down to just a few leaves since more leaf area equates to more water transpiration and that can exceed what the lack of roots and just forming roots (as the process proceeds) can support. Some people also do things like placing the pot with cuttings to root in a plastic bag or other very high humidity environment to reduce water stress, but that's a bit double-edged as it can also increase fungal problems.\n",
